        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 gms Chicken (Curry Cut)</li>
            <li>1 tsp Turmeric Powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Red Chilli Powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Garam Masala Powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Coriander Powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste</li>
            <li>4 tbsp Dahi</li>
            <li>to taste Salt</li>
            <li>2 cups Spinach Leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Kasuri Methi</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the chicken in salt, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, and 4 tbsp dahi for 30 minutes. Set aside while you prepare the remaining curry ingredients.</li>
            <li>One bunch each of coriander leaves, kasuri methi (fenugreek) leaves, four green chilies, and four to five cashew nuts should be added to a blender jar. Set that aside; don't blend it yet because the spinach leaves will be added later.</li>
            <li>To prevent the spinach leaves from sticking, heat a pan over medium heat and add just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Add 2 cups of spinach leaves, and cover the pan for about a minute to let the spinach wilt.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid after a minute and stir the spinach leaves until they are just wilted. If the spinach leaves are overcooked, they will lose their vibrant green color.</li>
        </ol>
